# Car Racing Game Project Proposal

## Project Overview
The **Car Racing Game** is a 2D racing game developed in C++ using the **Raylib** graphics library. The game will feature a player-controlled car that must navigate through a dynamic race track while avoiding obstacles and competing against AI-controlled opponents. The goal is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible while collecting power-ups and avoiding crashes.

## Objectives
- Develop a fast-paced racing game using **Raylib** in **C++**.
- Implement realistic physics for car movement and collision detection.
- Create a dynamic race track with various difficulty levels.
- Integrate AI-controlled opponents for an engaging single-player experience.
- Add power-ups and obstacles to enhance gameplay mechanics.

## Features

### 1. Core Gameplay
- Player-controlled racing car with smooth controls.
- AI-controlled opponents that react dynamically.
- Lap-based system to track progress and time.
- Speed boosts and power-ups to gain advantages.

### 2. Graphics and Visuals
- 2D top-down view racing track.
- Animated car sprites and visual effects.
- Dynamic environment with changing backgrounds.
- Particle effects for collisions and speed boosts.

### 3. Physics and Controls
- Smooth acceleration, braking, and drifting mechanics.
- Realistic collision detection and response.
- Keyboard and controller support for better player experience.

### 4. Game Modes
- **Single Race Mode**: Compete against AI opponents.
- **Time Trial Mode**: Complete laps as fast as possible.
- **Endless Mode**: Survive as long as possible while avoiding obstacles.

### 5. Sound and Music
- Background racing music for immersion.
- Sound effects for engine revs, collisions, and power-ups.

## Technology Stack
