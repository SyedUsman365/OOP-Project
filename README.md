# Invaders – A 2D Space Shooter Game

A 2D arcade-style shooting game built with **C++** and **Raylib**, inspired by the classic *Space Invaders*.  
This project showcases object-oriented design, structured programming, and efficient graphics handling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a simple but engaging 2D shooter game.
- Apply core C++ concepts: classes, inheritance, and pointers.
- Learn game development basics: game loops, input handling, collision detection, sprite handling.
- Gain hands-on experience with Raylib.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

| Tool/Technology | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| C++ | Core programming language |
| Raylib | Graphics, input, and sound handling |
| Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks | IDE for development |
| Git & GitHub | Version control and collaboration |
| Paint.net / Piskel | For designing 2D sprites (optional) |

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen.
- Shoot waves of descending enemy invaders.
- Dodge enemy bullets.
- Win by eliminating all enemies; lose if all lives are lost.

---

## 🚀 Game Features

- Smooth player movement and shooting via keyboard.
- Multiple enemy waves.
- Collision detection (bullets vs enemies, enemies vs player).
- Score tracking system.
- Game over screen with restart option.
- Basic sound effects and music (optional).

---

## 🔄 Game Loop Structure

1. **Initialize** – Setup window, load assets.
2. **Update** – Handle input, update objects, check collisions.
3. **Draw** – Render game elements.
4. **Unload** – Free resources and close the window.

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Left / Right Arrow | Move spaceship left/right |
| Spacebar | Fire bullets |

---

## 🧩 Key Implementation Highlights

- **Enemy Movement**: Group horizontal movement; descend and reverse at edges.
- **Collision Detection**: Bounding box checks for precision.
- **UI Elements**: Score display and game over screen.
- **Sound Effects**: Shooting, explosions, and background music (optional).

---

## 🧪 Testing and Debugging

- Manual testing for movement, shooting, collision, scoring.
- Debugging via Raylib’s drawing and message functions.
- Edge cases like multiple bullet hits and off-screen bullets handled.

---

## ⚡ Challenges Faced

- Learning Raylib's structure and syntax.
- Timing bullet firing and movement controls.
- Improving collision detection efficiency.
- Organizing code for better scalability and readability.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add multiple lives and health bar.
- Advanced enemy patterns and power-ups.
- Save and display high scores.
- Improve animations and UI polish.
- Introduce progressive levels and boss fights.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The **Invaders** project successfully demonstrates core game development principles using **C++** and **Raylib**. It bridges theoretical programming concepts with practical implementation, providing a solid base for future game development endeavors.
